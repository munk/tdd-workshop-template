# TDD Workshop Template
This repo is meant to go along with my TDD workshop. Participants will pair to write a a function that abbreviates a large number ie. `abbreviate(525600) => '526k'`. This exercise is done in javascript and requires at least Node version 6.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shoebox639/tdd-workshop-template.git
cd tdd-workshop-template
npm i
npm run watch
```

## Usage
Open both files side by side in your favorite text editor. Whenever you make changes to either source or test file, the unit tests will run.
